		<!-- BIO TEXT -->
		<p>Welcome to my first site of the Georgia Tech Coding Boot Camp. My name is Tom Wilson. I have lived in Atlanta only for about 2 years.  Previously, I lived in Jacksonville, Florida since 1989.</p> 

		<p>I have been working with the Internet since around 1997. One of my earliest related jobs was working in customer care for <a href="https://www.aol.com/" target="_blank">America Online</a>. That was beneficial for learning about the America Online platform and working with customers. </p>   

		<p>During that time, I attended some Internet, Office and programming courses. One of the earliest topics was that of upcoming cable modems, which were only one-way with a dial-in upstream. The technology has advanced far since that time.</p> 

		<p>Through an webmaster internship at the <a href="http://www.unf.edu/" target="_blank">University of North Forida</a>, I was able to proceed to my first job as a webmaster at the local cable company. Our goal was to provide robust content for the emerging cable modem technology.  This included bandwidth-rich interactive content and video.</p>   

		<p>One of the clients was a local TV station.  My job was to help code webpages and train station staff in updating the video content (using Real Video at the time).  The <a href="http://www.firstcoastnews.com/" target="_blank">WTLV website</a> was one of the first TV news websites to incorporate high quality streaming video.</p>  

		<p>I was hired by the TV station to help maintain the same website. Eventually, I moved to a corporate position where I help maintain web content for <a href="http://www.tegna.com" target="_blank">TV news stations</a> across the country.</p>  

		<p>The <a href="https://codingbootcamp.pe.gatech.edu/" target="_blank">Georgia Tech Coding Boot Camp</a> will help bring my web development skills up to date. I am already motivated to pursue training beyond the end of the Boot Camp and learn available technology trends.</p>
